# LingoDB
LingoDB is a cutting-edge data processing system that leverages compiler technology to achieve unprecedented flexibility and extensibility without sacrificing performance. It supports a wide range of data-processing workflows beyond relational SQL queries, thanks to declarative sub-operators. Furthermore, LingoDB can perform cross-domain optimization by interleaving optimization passes of different domains and its flexibility enables sustainable support for heterogeneous hardware.
